# Pilot Logbook

Pilot Logbook is an [ownCloud](https://owncloud.org/) app that pilots can use to log their flight time. It is a digital reproduction of ASA's Standard Pilot Log. Currently the app allows you to log flights, edit them, and view the complete log. Future versions will include more exciting features such as exporting the log to various formats and generating reports.

## System Requirements

Pilot Logbook requires ownCloud version 8.1 or greater.

## Installation

Installation is the same as other ownCloud apps. Place the contents of this repository in the 'apps' directory of your ownCloud deployment, login as admin, and enable the app.
